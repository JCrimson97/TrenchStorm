# TrenchStorm

I'm making my own Discord bot for my own server
So I decided to make part of the code public if anyone wants to collaborate with it.

## FEATURES

 > - Event handler and command handler.
 > - Embed based bot (Mostly).
 > - Lightweight without unused or unnecesary libraries.
 
 So you're welcome to help!
